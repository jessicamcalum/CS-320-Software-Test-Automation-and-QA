•	<b>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</b>

   To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I can incorporate the appropriate testing techniques to test them throughout the    development process. These projects allowed me to become familiar with various testing techniques and JUnit testing.  JUnit testing helped me to ensure   my code was functioning as expected and allowed me to view the test coverage to ensure that every instruction in my code had been executed in the tests.

•	<b>How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?</b>

   Requirements can be determined when the user’s needs are understood. These set of requirements enhance our understanding of how the product is expected to function to fulfill user needs. This project helped me to better understand the importance of establishing requirements and various testing techniques I could use to ensure I was meeting those requirements. 

•	<b>How do I approach designing software?</b>

   My approach to designing software for this project was directly aligned with the software requirements. I also made sure to write code in a way that was easy to understand and in a way that I knew how I could easily test it.
